                <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                <p>Terms of Service should be readable, because no one has the time to sit down and read a novel for an hour. That's why SpaceXStat's Terms of Service are in plain English.</p>
                
                <p>By being a member and using SpaceXStats, you agree to everything on this page. We have to do this to protect both you and us and make running this site possible. If you break these terms, you can't use SpaceXStats anymore.</p>

                <p>Your account is your responsibility. If your account is compromised we'll try to help, but we can't guarantee we can fix any damages. You can copy the SpaceXStats codebase according to the license conditions available on the <a href="https://github.com/LukeNZ/spacexstats">project GitHub page</a>.</p>

                <p>Don't upload any public-visible or subscriber-visible content on SpaceXStats that violates SpaceX's communications policy, is confidential to SpaceX or any other company, is U.S. Export Controlled, or violates the International Traffic of Arm Regulations. Don't upload content to SpaceXStats which could be considered offensive or is illegal. Follow all laws that apply to you, based on where you live or anything else.</p>

                <p>Content that you upload to SpaceXStats can be downloaded by other members of SpaceXStats, provided they meet your attribution & authorship criteria.</p>

                <p>Don't use SpaceXStats to do illegal actions or things which violates the site's rules. If you do, we'll remove your account and you personally are responsible for any trouble you cause.</p>

                <p>If your account is hacked, let us know right away. You must supply your own computer, monitor, internet, and electricity to access SpaceXStats. We might access your account to help with a support request, but we otherwise don't go browsing private accounts. If you send us an idea, we might use it, in which case it's protected by all the same rules on this page.</p>

                <p>All purchases of Mission Control are final, no refunds can be given. We will rebill your account after 1 year or when your deltaV expires, whatever is furthest in the future. If you're required to pay taxes on the purchase of Mission Control, that's on you. The price you pay for a subscription when you signed up is the price you will pay forever (excepting inflation). If we raise our prices beyond inflation, they won't affect you.</p>

                <p>We will delete anything that violates these rules. We have the right to take legal action against violations of these rules. If you need to report a copyright infringement, contact us.</p>

                <p>There might be downtime. There might be bugs. The features might not always meet your exact needs. You use SpaceXStats by your own free will and are responsible for your own actions. We respond to all users within 3 days, but with priority given to Mission Control subscribers (24 hours or less).</p>

                <p>We can't be liable for misuse of SpaceXStats or for SpaceXStats not meeting your needs. If you get in trouble with the law for something you did on SpaceXStats, that's on you and you agree that it isn't SpaceXStats itself's fault. If we receive notification of an infringement by you, we'll pass it along to you.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions, <a href="/about/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
