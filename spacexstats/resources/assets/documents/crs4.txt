Following a smooth pre-launch process involving just one weather-related scrub the day before, Falcon 9 v1.1 and Dragon lifted off into the Florida night sky on 21 September 2014 for the fourth of a nominal fifteen Cargo Resupply Services to the ISS for NASA. hauling 2216kg of cargo up to the station.

The ascent was smooth and without issues. After separation, the first stage performed an ocean landing like several flights before it, although it lacked landing legs due to an earlier core switch with AsiaSat 6. Although no telemetry or information about the landing was ever released, NASA recorded the vehicle's reentry into the atmosphere in infrared for study with applications for hypersonic Mars flight. The second stage continued to fire for a further 6 minutes, placing Dragon in a nominal 359 by 199km orbit inclined 51.6 degrees, allowing it to fire its thrusters and make its way towards a rendezvous with the ISS.

Among the cargo was the 589kg RapidSCAT instrument, designed to be attached to the ISS to measure wind speeds across the Earth's oceans. Stowed in Dragon's unpressurized trunk, at the time it was the heaviest single object carried in the trunk of Dragon thus far (CATS, which flew on the following CRS-5 mission, became a close second).

After setting yet another 34-day-record for time spent at the station, Dragon was unberthed from the Harmony module on 25 October. Its journey ended with splashdown in the Pacific off the coast of Baja California, another 1486kg of return mass back safely within the atmospheres. Less than 24 hours later,the time-critical experiments had been offloaded and Dragon was making its way to McGregor, Texas for post-mission processing.

This was the 6th and final flight for Falcon 9 for 2014, a new SpaceX cadence record.

In late November 2015, a 10 by 5.4 meter section of the carbon-fiber composite interstage from a Falcon 9 rocket washed up in Scilly, United Kingdom. Using a combination of ocean drift and photo analysis, members of the /r/SpaceX community were able to determine that it belonged to the F9-012 core from the CRS-4 mission, having floated northeast across the Atlantic for over a year.
