With the launch of AsiaSat 6 in September 2014, SpaceX completed its first multi-satellite launch contract, which was first inked with Hong Kong-based AsiaSat as a $104.4m deal to launch two 4500kg-class communications satellites to geostationary transfer orbit. SpaceX was now well into a record-setting year too, AsiaSat 6 provided the 12th launch of Falcon 9, and the 5th this year; all flying out of Launch Complex 40.

Slightly lighter than its companion satellite launched a month before, AsiaSat 6 still has a gross mass that exceeded Falcon 9's capability to perform a downrange ocean landing, thus the rocket flew in its "naked" configuration with no landing legs. However, a shuffling of SpaceX's launch manifest saw AsiaSat 6 flight on F9-013, despite this being the 12th flight of Falcon 9, with F9-012, the core originally destined for AsiaSat 6, lifting the CRS-4 Dragon mission to the International Space Station. As SpaceX was producing two core variants at the time, this resulted in the AsiaSat 6 carrying a core designed for legs (thus, had prominent leg-attachment points).

It was during this launch campaign that SpaceX's experimental VTVL testing platform, F9R, destroyed itself in flight during testing over McGregor, Texas due to a faulty engine sensor. Despite Musk stating there was no possibility for commonality between the two vehicles, SpaceX took the time to recheck the vehicle and ensure it was in a flightworthy condition.

Falcon 9 finally lifted off on September 7 for a second consecutive night launch, which proceeded nominally. Spacecraft separation occurred at approximately T+37 minutes, setting the satellite up to inject itself into Geostationary Earth Orbit with its onboard apogee motor.
