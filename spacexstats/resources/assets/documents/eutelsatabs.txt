On 1 March 2015, Falcon 9 soared into the Florida late night sky above Cape Canaveral, carrying two unusual payloads in an unusual manner just weeks after the DSCOVR mission. The vehicle carried two satellites underneath the protective payload fairing- one for French satellite provider Eutelsat, and the other for Bermuda-based satellite operator ABS. This marked SpaceX’s first dual launch. The launch campaign was smooth, with a single delay from 27 February to the day it actually launched. The Flight Readiness Review took place just under a week before, and was followed by a successful static fire two days later.

The launch began at 22:50 EDT, and proceeded smoothly with no issues during countdown or flight. Eight minutes and 42 seconds after engine ignition, the second stage had successfully delivered both satellites (with a combined mass of 4159kg) into a parking orbit, raising that orbit slightly after a short coast and readying itself for payload separation. The manner in which they were carried was one on top of the other, with ABS-3A being stowed above Eutelsat West 115 B. ABS-3A was released at approximately the 30-minute mark, and Eutelsat West 115 B five minutes later. Both satellites used solar-electric propulsion to push themselves from the parking orbit into their final geostationary orbits, allowing for massive weight savings over conventional chemical fuels like hydrazine. 

The respective CEOs of ABS and Eutelsat praised the performance of Falcon 9 after the flight, noting that both satellites were scheduled to arrive over a month earlier than expected, translating into increased revenue.

The weight of the two satellites required Falcon 9’s full capacity, thus this flight did not attempt to land the first stage on a solid surface like CRS-5, nor did it attempt a powered splashdown in the ocean. The next try would be CRS-6, the very next flight.

A very similar mission is scheduled to take place in 2016 with the launch of Eutelsat 117W B & ABS-2A.
