Less than 6 months after the first launch of Falcon 9, the second vehicle, F9-002, thundered off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral on 8 December 2010. It had one goal- to lift the first operational Dragon spacecraft into orbit for 3 hours. Dragon's goals for COTS Demo 1 were an in-orbit checkout of the spacecraft's systems and to successfully reenter, which it did 3 hours 19 minutes and 52 seconds after launch after two orbits around the Earth. Reentry placed it in in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California under its trio of white and red parachutes - the first privately developed spacecraft to orbit Earth and then re-enter. All objectives of the mission were met, which cleared SpaceX to begin the next mission, COTS 2+, which involved rendezvous maneuvers and a berthing with the ISS.

The mission was picture perfect: "It's actually almost too good," Mr. Musk said. "We didn't have to go to backup systems at any point. I'm sort of in semishock." The flight proceeded despite several cracks being noticed in the outer portions of the Niobium skirt of the second stage engine. The solution was to trim the un-needed four feet off of the nozzle just a few days before launch, as the resulting performance loss was not critical.

Less reported on was the deployment of 8 additional secondary satellites which separated from Dragon and the upper stage once in orbit - a numerical SpaceX record that remains to date. These included SMDC-ONE 1, QbX 1 & 2, Mayflower-Caerus, and Perseus 000-003.

In addition to the 8 other secondary satellites, stowed away aboard the spacecraft was a secret payload which wasn't revealed until after the mission splashed down. Musk was noticeably secretive, "It's kind of funny, If you like Monty Python, you'll love the secret". The secret was later revealed to be a large wheel of Gruyere cheese, purchased from the Beverly Hills Cheese Shop - complete with the words "Top Secret!" emblazoned on the cover. Musk stated that he never did try the cheese after it came back from orbit, noting that "it looked off".
