With Falcon 1 development halted, Falcon 9 & the Dragon spacecraft became SpaceX's main focus in 2009. Falcon 9 v1.0 featured 9 Merlin 1C engines arranged in a 3x3 grid (now replaced with the more efficient 'octaweb configuration’ and Merlin 1D engines), because "[at the time] we didn't know what we were doing". The maiden launch of the 333-ton Falcon 9 was a complete success, bar the vehicle experiencing "a little bit of roll at liftoff" - which stopped by the time the rocket had cleared the tower. This was the launch of the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, and while it was not a functional Dragon spacecraft, this launch still resulted in many firsts apart from the rocket itself. This was the first liftoff of a SpaceX vehicle from the continental United States and as well as the first launch of a SpaceX vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Before the launch, Musk was quoted as saying "Given that this is a test flight, whatever percentage of getting to orbit we achieve would still be considered a good day. If just the first stage functions correctly, it's a good day. It's a great day if both stages function."

Falcon 9 started its historic journey on 4 June 2010 at 1845 UTC, and entered a 250km orbit minutes later. After stage separation, the first stage’s parachutes failed to deploy and it was destroyed on impact when it hit the Atlantic Ocean. After launch, the DSQU’s onboard batteries failed (as expected) and contact with the spacecraft was lost. The qualification unit was left in Low Earth Orbit, where it completed 300 orbits before re-entering in the early morning hours (UTC) on 27 June 2010, likely over Syria or Iraq.

The mission was declared a complete success, and paved the way for SpaceX to start fulfilling its Commercial Orbital Transportation Services contract to enable Dragon to resupply the International Space Station.
