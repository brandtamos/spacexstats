On 8 October 2012, SpaceX began its first of at least twelve resupply missions to the International Space Station with the launch of the Dragon spacecraft atop the 4th (and penultimate) Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket. A Wet Dress Rehearsal of the rocket was completed on 31 August, followed by a 29 September static fire. 76 seconds into the light, the #1 Merlin 1C engine on the first stage suffered a loss of pressure, triggering an engine shutdown - debris could be seen in the telescopic video of the launch. However, the vehicle was able to compensate for the reduced performance by burning the remaining 8 engines for a longer length of time, demonstrating for the first time Falcon 9's unique engine out capability, a feature long touted by SpaceX. In spite of the engine failure, the second stage managed to insert Dragon into a "flawless" orbit.

Catching a ride as a secondary payload was the Orbcomm FM44 satellite. Due to safety regulations required by NASA to reduce the potential for orbital conflicts between the ISS and similar-inclination objects, a greater than 99% probability is required that the second stage will reach its orbital destination. With the loss of the number one engine, and the additional fuel used to compensate for this, the probability for Orbcomm FM44 dropped to 95%. Due to these regulations, SpaceX was unable to attempt an upper stage restart and Orbcomm FM44 was placed into a low, rapidly-decaying orbit, subsequently being declared a loss.

Dragon berthed with the ISS on flight day 3, and 454kg of cargo was unloaded. Another 905kg of experiments was returned, comprising roughly one sixth of its upmass capability, and one third of its downmass capability. After nearly 18 days attached to the station, Dragon was unberthed and reentered the atmosphere on 28 October 2012.
