Flight 5 delivered SpaceX's first successful commercial payload into orbit, the 180kg RazakSat satellite for the Malaysian government. The ascent proceeded smoothly, with no problems reported after a liftoff at 3:35 UTC on 14 July 2009. The relatively uneventful flight was delayed twice due to stormy weather and an equipment malfunction. Roughly 10 minutes after liftoff, the second stage shut down, and the Earth-observing satellite entered orbit. The second stage of the vehicle, like that of Falcon 1’s 4th flight, also remains in orbit to this day.

This flight was the last for Falcon 1, which had first flown in 2006. Only the final 2 missions were successful, with the first 3 all failing to reach Earth orbit for varying reasons. Initially, an enhanced variant of Falcon 1 was to be its replacement. Named Falcon 1E, it would have been a stretched version with a wider payload fairing and more powerful upper and lower stages, including a modified upper stage engine named Kestrel 2. It was projected to be able to carry 1 ton into Low Earth Orbit for $12 million.

SpaceX however, had majorly shifted their focus to fulfilling its potentially far more profitable NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services obligations. As such, development of Dragon and the much more powerful Falcon 9 became the main priority. Falcon 1E’s development was halted, and as of 2012 "Current plans are for payloads that would fly on Falcon 1 to be served by flights on the Falcon 9, utilizing excess capacity".

Ultimately, Falcon 1 gave SpaceX experience and and crucial insight into the process of developing rockets, and it remains to date one of only three rockets designed completely in the 21st century, along with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.
