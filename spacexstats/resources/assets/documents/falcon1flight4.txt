Carrying another mass simulator - this time weighing 165kg and nicknamed "RatSat", Falcon 1 for the first time achieved mission success and became the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit on 28 September 2008. A test firing occurred on the 20th of September, and over the next 8 days changes were made to a pipeline supplying the second stage Kestrel engine with liquid oxygen.

Liftoff occurred 15 minutes into the 5 hour launch window. At T+9:31, the second stage engine shut down after reaching orbit, something all 3 previous Falcon 1 flights had failed to accomplish. The vehicle’s initial orbit was 330x650km. After a short coast period, the second stage of Falcon 1 restarted, and performed a second successful burn that placed the mass simulator in a 621x643km orbit with an inclination of 9.35 degrees.

Although original plans for the Falcon 1 were for the first stage to deploy a parachute and splashdown downrange from the launch site to be recovered and reused, no flight succeeded in doing so. Stage recovery was a secondary goal however and not required for mission success.

Elon Musk, the company's founder and CEO, called the launch a "great day for SpaceX" as he addressed the then-500-employee company. “The data shows we achieved a super precise orbit insertion--middle of the bull's eye--and then went on to coast and restart the second stage, which was icing on the cake." ... "This is one of the best days of my life."

The day after completing this landmark mission, NASA phoned, with an International Space Station resupply contract worth nearly $2 billion. "I couldn't even be professional" with them on the phone, Musk said. "I told them, 'I love you.'"

To this day, the Falcon 1 Flight 4 upper stage remains in a 620x640km orbit around the earth.
