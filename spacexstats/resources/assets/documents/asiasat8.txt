The first in a series of four night launches conducted by SpaceX, AsiaSat 8 was the 11th flight of Falcon 9 and the 3rd geostationary satellite lofted into a high-energy geosynchronous transfer orbit.  Announced February 8, 2012 by Hong Kong-based AsiaSat, SpaceX was first scheduled to launch the two communications birds in 2014, for a price of $52.2 million per satellite, which undercut other launch industry prices and was fully half the price of the backup vehicle: Proton.

Following the helium-problem-plagued launch campaign of Orbcomm OG2 Launch 2, the preparations for AsiaSat 8 proceeded smoothly, with a static fire taking place on 31 July. After integration with the satellite, Falcon 9 was rolled out on August 4 for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 30 later that night.

At 4535kg each, Asiasat 8 was the heaviest satellite SpaceX had flown so far. This precipitated a need for Falcon 9's first stage to provide the highest performance possible, and as such no soft ocean landing was attempted. However, it is likely a high-velocity reentry test or a burn to propellant extinction was planned.

Lifting off well into the early hours of the morning at 4AM EDT, the flight went smoothly, with Falcon 9 placing the 24 Ku-band equipped bird into a 200km by 176km Low Earth parking orbit, inclined 27.7 degrees to the equator. Later, at T+26 minutes, the Merlin Vacuum engine on Falcon 9's second stage relit for 1 minute, providing the extra velocity needed to throw the satellite out to an apogee at geostationary orbital altitude, approximately 35,700km. At T+33 minutes, the spacecraft was separated from the payload adapter.
